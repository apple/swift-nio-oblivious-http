# swift-nio-oblivious-http

A library for working using Oblivious HTTP with Swift NIO.

## Overview

Oblivous HTTP is a protocol to allow a client to make requests of a server without the 
server being able to identify the source of those requests.  Multiple requests from the 
same client also can't be identified as having originated from the same node.

A trusted relay is used to prevent metadata being used for tracking purposes while the 
payload is encrypted to ensure only the destination can access it.

## Supported Swift Versions

This library was introduced with support for Swift 5.8 or later. This library will
support the latest stable Swift version and the two versions prior.
